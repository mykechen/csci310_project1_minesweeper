# Android Minesweeper

This repository contains the source code for a classic Minesweeper game developed for the Android platform as part of the CSCI-310 course. The application provides a complete game loop on a 10x10 grid, featuring a timer, gameplay modes, and a results screen.

## Features

*   **Classic Gameplay**: Familiar Minesweeper experience on a 10x10 grid with 5 randomly placed mines.
*   **Dual Modes**: Seamlessly switch between two modes:
    *   **Dig Mode (‚õèÔ∏è)**: Reveal cells to clear the board.
    *   **Flag Mode (üö©)**: Mark cells suspected of containing mines.
*   **Game Timer**: A timer starts on your first move and tracks your game duration.
*   **Recursive Reveal**: Clicking a cell with zero adjacent mines automatically reveals all neighboring empty cells.
*   **Game Over States**: The game concludes with a win by clearing all safe cells or a loss by revealing a mine.
*   **Results Screen**: After each game, a dedicated screen displays your win/loss status and the total time taken.
*   **Play Again**: A convenient button on the results screen allows you to start a new game immediately.

## How to Play

1.  The game board is a 10x10 grid of hidden cells.
2.  Tap the **‚õèÔ∏è / üö©** icon at the bottom of the screen to toggle between Dig and Flag modes.
3.  **In Dig Mode**: Tap a cell to reveal its content.
    *   If you reveal a mine (üí£), you lose the game.
    *   If you reveal a number, it indicates how many mines are in the eight adjacent cells.
    *   If you reveal a blank cell, all adjacent safe cells will be uncovered automatically.
4.  **In Flag Mode**: Tap a cell to place a flag. Tap it again to remove the flag. You cannot dig a flagged cell.
5.  Win the game by revealing all cells on the board that are not mines.
